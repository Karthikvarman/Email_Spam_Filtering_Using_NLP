# Email_Spam_Filtering_Using_NLP

This Email spam filtering is a crucial task in modern communication systems, aimed at 
automatically identifying and segregating unsolicited and potentially harmful messages. With 
the increasing volume of email traffic, traditional rule-based filtering methods have become 
inadequate due to the evolving and sophisticated techniques employed by spammers. This study 
explores the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for effective email 
spam filtering. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this research focuses on developing 
a robust spam detection system that can accurately distinguish between legitimate (ham) and 
unsolicited (spam) emails. The proposed methodology involves text preprocessing, feature 
extraction, and model training using various machine learning classifiers. Performance 
evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The 
outcomes of this research aim to enhance the reliability and efficiency of spam filters, 
contributing to safer and more secure email communication.

The solution involves two primary components: 
1. Keyword-Based Filtering: A predefined list of keywords is used to quickly classify 
emails as spam or non-spam. 
2. NLP-Based Analysis: Text analysis techniques such as tokenization, stemming, 
stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization enhance the system's ability to detect 
spam, even in cases where keyword obfuscation or context is involved.
